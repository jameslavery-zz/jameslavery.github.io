I've been getting good feedback from the beta testing team - thank you!

*A note on references*. The references below are the IDs of work items in the GitHub management system.

## Feedback

The following feedback items have been received and allocated a work reference.

Ref|Item|Notes|
----|-----|--------------------|
[12](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/12)|Limit the level to which the map can be zoomed||
[34](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/34)|Dark theme.|On a device with a dark theme set, some items (e.g. the menu) don't show up well.|
[35](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/35)|Scale legibility.|The grey text colour is not very legible. Black would be better.|
[36](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/36)|Allow graphs to be re-orderd.|Some users may want Barometric Pressure before Air Temperature, for example.|
[38](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/38)|NESW on wind direction.|This is easier to read than compass degrees.|
[39](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/39)|Graph zoom.|Allow zoom in on a graph, to expand a time period.|
[40](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/40)|Tidal data|Add a link to tidal data (high/low water).|

# Roadmap

The following items have been identified as bugs which need to be addressed, or general improvements.

Ref|Item|Notes|
----|-----|--------------------|
[10](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/10)|Add water temperature|This is not displayed for Chimet, even though it is available.|
[18](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/18)|Allow map view to be reset.|If the map is panned/zoomed, have a simple button which returns to the original view.|[29](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/29)|Graph scales need to be consistent.|For example, the barometric graph currently shows a narrow millibar range around the live readings.|
[20](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/20)|Ensure that the 'no internet connection' message clears.|This does not always occur when data connection is restored.|
[30](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/30)|Move graph vertical scale units.|These can be incorporated into the legend, to save space on the left (e.g. 'Wind Speed kts'|
[32](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/32)|Indicate when data is being refreshed.|A visual indicator is needed of when the app is busy refreshing data from the server.|
[37](https://github.com/jameslavery/SolentMet/issues/37)|Barometric pressure only on Chimet.|This is not available on the other stations. Graph should be removed.|
