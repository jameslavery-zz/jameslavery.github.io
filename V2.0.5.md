# V2.0.5
The following changes have been made for V2.0.5

Ref|Item|Notes|
----|-----|--------------------|
#55|Live station status.|The top panel for a station now has an 'info' icon. Tapping this gives information on the station's status. __Statuses are updated live, as data is updated.__ The background is also colour coded according to status (grey=normal, yellow=warning, red=abnormal)|
#53|Reduced label length on wind panel.|The wind/gust speed were too long for some devices. The decimal points have been removed, and the descriptions shortened in order to reduce the likelihood of the information stretching too far.|
